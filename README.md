GREENIFY is a gamified environmental education platform that transforms textbook-based learning into interactive, action-driven experiences. It combines mini-games, real-world challenges, and a 3D Unity simulation game to help students understand the impact of their daily choices on the environment.

🚨 Problem

Environmental education in most schools and colleges remains theoretical.
Students learn concepts but fail to:

Connect them with real-life actions

Understand consequences of lifestyle choices

Develop sustainable habits

Awareness without action is useless.
